# UX-UI-Website-design
For my HCI course, I embraced the challenge of designing an Aston Martin website using Adobe XD. This project was an exercise in blending aesthetics with usability, adhering to the iconic color theme of Aston Martin to create a visual experience that resonates with the brandâ€™s elegance. The design captures the essence of luxury and performance synonymous with Aston Martin, providing an intuitive user interface that car enthusiasts and potential customers will find both engaging and informative.
